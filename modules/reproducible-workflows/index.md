# Reproducible Work flows

This module will introduce you to how to conduct your research in a reproducible way. As you are aware, reproducibility is a core tenet of science. (One more line about science in crisis or something). So far in this course you have learnt a number of tools (shell, Git, Python) that will help you work in a reproducible way. Automating your work flow with these tools will help increase the speed at which you work, and decrease the number of errors you make. (Something about transparency of your work to yourself and others)

## Group | Make your workflow reproducible

Time to start using the various technical skills you have developed so far (Shell, Git, Python) in the course towards creating a reproducible work flow. During this Hacky Hour you should start/continue working on making your work flow for this project completely reproducible. Document your work flow, clean up your code and push it to your Github.
