title: Shell
introduction: This module will introduce you to the benefits of using shell commands to perform data management and analysis as part of your workflow. The shell offers a powerful and succint way of accessing the core functionality of your computer system, and can be used to automate data processing. You interact with the shell via the command line, typing out tasks you want your computer to perform.

learning-outcomes:

  - a. Navigate through a file system and list files within different folders using the commmand line
  - b. Create, move, and delete files using the command line
  - c. Run programs and open files from the command line
  - d. Combine commands, such as filters,  using pipes to perform more complex data processing tasks 
  - e. Reason about how to automate simple tasks using the command line.

## Group | Stats

Idea: gather stats on your project using commands you've learned. Document the command and the output of the command. Compose a script that outputs these current stats for you project.

This Hacky Hour should be used to start managing and organising your data using the skills and concepts you learnt in the Data Management module, using the command line where possible.
