## What You Need
Printed Principles
Printed Values
A3 poster paper
Glue / tape
Coloured pens / pencils
Scissors



## Overview

Participants will match each of the Agile Manifesto's 12 principles with one of the 4 corresponding values. The group will then create a poster of their mapping.



## Part 1: Introduction (5 min)

- Read through the values and principles if you haven't already
- Discuss the difference between a value and a principle
- Form teams of at least 2 people
- Explain the game: match each of the principles to a value



## Part 2: Group Matching (10 min)

- Participants discuss the matching within teams
- Teams must make a choice for each principle



## Part 3: Class Matching (10 min)

- As a class, discuss where each principle fits
- More deeply discuss contrasting decisions



## Part 4: Class Discussion (10 min)

- Are any of the principles unclear?
- Is it necessary to match principles to values?
- How would team dynamics change if we adopted all these guidelines?
- How can we individually ensure we adhere tothe guidelines?
- What can we do as a team to meet this goal?



## Part 5: Make the Poster (20 min)

- Represent the manifesto in poster form however you think fits
- Everybody sign the poster
- Display in a prominent place



## Pro Tips

- Build teams from people who don't know each other, to foster friendship.
- Print the values on a different colour of paper from the principles.
- Teams may pursue the "right" answer, or try to divide the principles evenly between the values. Let them!
- The aim of the game is conversation and discussion, so pose questions to teams to encourage this.
