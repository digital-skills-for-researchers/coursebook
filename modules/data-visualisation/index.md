# Data Visualization

This module will introduce you to the theory of visualization, as well as how to create effective scientific visualizations in a variety of different forms. Developing your visualization skills will make you a more effective communicator. Now that you are comfortable doing basic programming in Python, you have access to some very powerful tools for visualizing your data. 


## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module you should be able to:

- a. Understands the basic principles of data visulzation. Can apply these princples to design new, and improve existing, visulzations. 
- b. Understand common ways of displaying scientific data, and can pick an appropriate way of displaying data
- c. Can create visualizations methodically, considering what the message is, who are the audience and what is the nature of of the data.
- e. Can generate visualizations in a programmatic/reproducible way using Python
